# Inclusive Starter

> Open source React component library for building accessible user interfaces. Features auto-save forms, empathetic error messages, and components designed for real people in stressful situations. 

**Accessibility isn't a feature, it's the foundation.**

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is in early development. Components and documentation are being actively developed.

**⭐ Star this repo to follow the progress!**

## Why Inclusive Starter?

Most UI libraries treat accessibility as an afterthought: a checklist to complete before launch. Inclusive Starter takes a different approach: **designing for real humans in real situations from day one**.

### Built for people who are:
- 😴 Tired
- ⏰ In a hurry
- 🤯 Stressed
- 🧠 Distracted
- ♿ Using assistive technology
- 📱 On a slow connection
- 🔆 In bright sunlight
- 🚇 On public transport

If your interface only works when users have perfect focus and unlimited time, **it doesn't work**.

## Design Principles

### 1. Interruptions are normal
- ✅ Auto-save in all forms
- ✅ "Continue where you left off" functionality
- ✅ Never lose user data

**Why:** Life happens. Kids cry, phones ring, doors knock. Good design doesn't punish interruptions.

### 2. Mistakes are okay
- ✅ Easy undo
- ✅ No aggressive confirmation dialogs
- ✅ "Are you sure?" → "You can undo this later"

**Why:** Errors are human. Good design forgives them.

### 3. Minimal cognitive load
- ✅ One thing at a time
- ✅ Clear progress indicators
- ✅ No unnecessary choices

**Why:** Tired, stressed, or neurodivergent users need clarity, not complexity.

### 4. Works in stressful situations
- ✅ Large click targets (easy to hit)
- ✅ High contrast
- ✅ No hidden actions

**Why:** Hands shake, vision blurs, time is short. Design shouldn't add stress.

### 5. Safe to use in public
- ✅ Doesn't show sensitive data by default
- ✅ Privacy-first design
- ✅ Non-intrusive notifications

**Why:** Many people use services in public places—buses, cafes, workplaces.

### 6. Technical accessibility
- ✅ WCAG AA (or AAA where possible)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Screen reader optimized
- ✅ Semantic HTML

**Why:** Legal requirement, but more importantly: human necessity.
